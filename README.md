# blog

This repository contains the source code of my blog [visibilityspots.com](https://visibilityspots.com) generated using [pelican](http://getpelican.com).

[One.com](http://one.com) is my hosting provider for the moment, the generated static html structure is pushed using rsync to their webserver.

[Github](http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tips.html#publishing-to-github) also provides support for static html pages. It's hosted in the gh-pages branch of this repository which can be viewed at [visibilityspots.github.io/blog/](https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/)
