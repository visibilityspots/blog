Me, myself I do use it merely to automate the many different use cases asked by various projects. It took some time to get myself organized with this pretty nifty piece of software.</p>
<p>In the beginning I used it with the default virtualization provider <a href="https://virtualbox.org">virtualbox</a> later on I switched to <a href="https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/vagrant-setup.html">lxc</a> containers instead.

The whole idea behind this proof of concept is based on the flexibility to spin up and down certain instances providing some specific functionality so tests banks can be ran against them.</p>
<p>As soon as the tests are finished the machines could be terminated. Those instances should be configured using some configuration management software, like <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source">puppet</a>. That way the instances are rebuildable and could be treated as cattle.</p>
