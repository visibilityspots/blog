Since we've setted up a <a href="https://smashing.github.io/">smashing</a> instance to create dashboards for each team this was a huge bummer.</p>
<p>While looking for a stable solution many teams brought their own raspberry pi's, chromecasts, airtame devices to at least be able to show something on the displays in the meanwhile.</p>
