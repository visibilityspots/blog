Automating the validation environment for the `dialog`_ infrastructure using different types of open-source tools like puppet for configuration management, looking at packer for building reproducible image artefacts and a private cloud for the provisioning part.

+ Configuring `packer.io`_ templates for the cloud images
+ Setting up an openstack private cloud in line with the current validation environment

Next to the use case of the validation tests on the openstack private cloud also using it to have virtual development environments for the dialog platforms so developers have a flexible way of developing/bugfixing the product.

Using the many benefits of this setup in a way so automated builds of the dialog product are deployed immediately so bugs are discovered as fast as possible within the development cycle.

Last but not least using this virtual environment to bootstrap hardware components within the dialog platform so they match as much as possible the production environments for validation tests.
