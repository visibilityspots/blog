Since the beginning of my touch on openstack networking has been the hardest part to get my head around. In the first place because openstack does some nifty things on the networking path. But also cause for the use case at the customer a lot of customization has been done to get it implemented in their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the shiver when the MTU question was been made..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless together with a colleague who likes a challenge and has a profound knowledge …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2017-03-23:/blog/openstack-mtu.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>openstack</category><category>mtu</category><category>kilo</category><category>neutron</category><category>nova</category><category>config</category><category>ovs</category></item><item><title>S3stat</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/s3stat.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago an article on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12634447"&gt;hacker news&lt;/a&gt; got my interest. From time to time I really get an healthy dose of jealousy when people found an idea which could make them buy a tesla. My terms of someone who make a lot of money ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is so brilliant in it's simplicity that I really was flabbergasted and made me wonder why I never came up with the idea. It generates nice reports of the usage of your site which is hosted by aws. Based on the logs of the S3 bucket or the cloudfront domain you setted up …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2016-10-26:/blog/s3stat.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>s3stat</category><category>aws</category><category>analytics</category><category>statistics</category><category>web</category><category>refers</category><category>s3</category><category>cdn</category><category>cloudfront</category></item><item><title>AWS migration</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/aws-migration.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I attended the &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/events/awsome-day/benelux/belgium/"&gt;AWSome Day&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://lamot-mechelen.be"&gt;Mechelen&lt;/a&gt;. Back then I wrote a first draft article about it, but it got out of my sight unfortunately. I reviewed it and decided to publish it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was based on their essentials course and took use through the different AWS core services (compute, storage, database and network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know it has nothing to see with open-source. But it is a part of that ultimate cloud based setup I believe in which exists in one central place from where you can manage all your virtual machines independent …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2016 21:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2016-09-18:/blog/aws-migration.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>aws</category><category>awsome</category><category>awesome. cloud</category><category>amazon</category><category>migration</category><category>pelican</category><category>rds</category></item><item><title>Openstack static ip</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/openstack-static-ip.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;last couple of days I have been fighting with the way an static ip is configured on an openstack virtual centos 6 instance. In our specific use case we ditched as many network openstack services as possible as I &lt;a href="https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/openstack-layer2.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to have the instances running in our current network spaces of the R&amp;amp;D department. In this department until some days ago we didn't had any DHCP server running. But a few weeks back we added an extra remote network space into our platform where we configured a remote compute-node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the issues started popping …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2016-09-05:/blog/openstack-static-ip.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>openstack</category><category>rdo</category><category>kilo</category><category>static</category><category>ip</category><category>dhcp</category><category>cloud-init</category><category>config</category><category>drive</category><category>centos</category></item><item><title>Openstack live-migration</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/openstack-live-migration.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may already have notices others just stumbled on this post through a search engine, I have set up an openstack private cloud at one of our projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/vlan-flat-neutron-provider.html"&gt;vlan flat-neutron provider network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/openstack-layer2.html"&gt;layer2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have noticed that the benefits of having a private cloud is spreading through the different teams within the organization and therefore the interest into this flexibility is growing. Since this wasn't the original &lt;a href="https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/vlan-flat-neutron-provider.html"&gt;use case&lt;/a&gt; we are encountering some design issues right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the original instances the default &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/compute_nodes.html#overcommit"&gt;overcommit&lt;/a&gt; ratios are fine. But the request for new machines with other goals are like …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2016 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2016-04-21:/blog/openstack-live-migration.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>openstack</category><category>live</category><category>migration</category><category>kilo</category><category>kvm</category><category>block</category><category>config</category><category>drive</category><category>vfat</category></item><item><title>Openstack layer2</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/openstack-layer2.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I implemented an RDO based openstack kilo release private cloud at one of our customers for their development platform. Through time we tackled a couple of issues so the cloud could be fitted into their work flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled onto some minor issues and some major ones. Let's begin with the minor ones ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When upgrading the all-in-one controller before we started using the cloud in 'production' a mean &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1284978"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; bit us in the ankle due to a new hiera package. After some digging around a &lt;a href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/249301/3/packstack/modules/ospluginutils.py"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; came to the rescue together with the exclusion of the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 20:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2016-02-26:/blog/openstack-layer2.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>openstack</category><category>layer2</category><category>security</category><category>groups</category><category>linux</category><category>bridge</category><category>ovs</category><category>open</category><category>vswitch</category><category>dhcp</category><category>kilo</category><category>rdo</category></item><item><title>Openstack vlan based flat neutron network provider</title><link>https://visibilityspots.github.io/blog/vlan-flat-neutron-provider.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;at one of my projects I was been asked to set up a private cloud for a validation platform. The whole idea behind this proof of concept is based on the flexibility to spin up and down certain instances providing some specific functionality so tests banks can be ran against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the tests are finished the machines could be terminated. Those instances should be configured using some configuration management software, like &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source"&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt;. That way the instances are rebuildable and could be treated as cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it takes about 20 minutes to build up an …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>tag:visibilityspots.github.io,2015-09-29:/blog/vlan-flat-neutron-provider.html</guid><category>cloud</category><category>vlan</category><category>flat</category><category>neutron</category><category>provider</category><category>network</category><category>openstack</category><category>openvswitch</category><category>ovs</category></item></channel></rss>
